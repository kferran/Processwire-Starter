# Processwire Starter
Simple starting point to manage the frontend of a processwire cms site.

## Configuration
### Build Process
This starter uses of the Blendid package from Vigetlabs (https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid) for a gulp/webpack build setup.
1. path-config.json - manages all paths for the build process
2. task-config.js - allows for customizing the different gulp tasks that Blendid provides. I have a task to help with managing template files and moving them for the Processwire workflow that I like.
